       <p>Pizza</p>
       <p><img src="pizza.jpg" style="width: 170px; height: 170px; margin-left: 15px; float: right;">
        Pizza[a][1] is an Italian, specifically Neapolitan, dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based
        dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in awood-fired
        oven. The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on
        the border with Campania.[2] Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the modern pizza in Naples.[3][4][5][6] In
        2009, Neapolitan pizza[7] was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish. In
        2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[8]

        <p>Dosa</p>
        <p><img src="dosa.webp" style="width: 170px; height: 170px; margin-left: 15px; float: right;">
        The dosa originated in South India, but its precise geographical origins are unknown. According to food historian K. T.
        Achaya, references in the Sangam literature suggest that dosa was already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the
        first century CE.[1] However, according to historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the town of Udupi in
        Karnataka.[2] Achaya states that the earliest written mention of dosa appears in the eighth-century literature of
        present-day Tamil Nadu, while the earliest mention of dosaÃ« in Tulu literature appears a century later.[3]
