        The Solar System,[d] named after Sōl, the Latin name for the Sun, is the planetary system of the Sun and the celestial
        objects that orbit it.[11] It formed about 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed,
        forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc. The Sun is a typical star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion
        of hydrogen into helium at its core, releasing this energy from its outer photosphere. Astronomers classify it as a
        G-type main-sequence star.</p>
